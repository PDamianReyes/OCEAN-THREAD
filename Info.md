# Illegal fishing

The US is one of the largest seafood markets for imported seafood—importing more than 5.3 billion pounds of seafood per year—worth almost $18 billion annually. Unfortunately, there is a problem with the seafood that hits our plates. Right now we simply cannot tell if the fish we eat was legally caught because our current laws are not strong enough to trace from bait to plate.

# Unscrupulous fishing worsens the problems

Nowadays, the world’s fish stocks are not only under threat from intensive legal fishing activities; they are also at risk from illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing. It is difficult to estimate precisely the total catch from pirate fishing. Researchers are engaged in the painstaking process of collating data from various countries’ fisheries control agencies, experts’ estimates, trade figures and the findings of independent research expeditions in order to arrive at an approximate figure for the total IUU catch.

# Global risks of labor abuse and illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing

Labor abuse on fishing vessels and illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing violate
human rights, jeopardize food security, and deprive governments of revenues.

# Combatting illegal fishing through transparency initiatives

Over the last two decades, efforts to combat illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing have led to an expansion of initiatives to enhance transparency across the seafood industry through international agreements, national government regulations, and voluntary private initiatives.
